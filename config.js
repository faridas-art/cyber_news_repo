// Optional runtime configuration for CyberNews frontend.
// Place this file in the repo root (served by GitHub Pages) to override
// the API base URL or to provide deployment-time configuration.

// To point the frontend to a real backend, uncomment and set the value below:
// window.API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-backend.example';

// Leave this file as-is (or keep it empty) to let the frontend use demo mode
// when no backend is available. The Diagnostics panel also lets you set an
// API URL at runtime (saved in localStorage) for testing.
